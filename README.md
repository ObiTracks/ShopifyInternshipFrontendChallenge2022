# Obi I. - Shopify Frontend Challenge 2022 - Logistics Company Webapp

*So I submitted the shopify backend challenge, then after I finished I decided to to try the rest of the internship challenges since they were starting to seem fun.

But then one of my friends said they didn't think I could finish another by the midnight deadline (I started at 8pm) and here we are - the second production engineering challenge launched & submitted launched and this third frontend challenge was done in a day. Glad I built all these since it felt like a hackathon.*

## How it works

The site works by allowing users to submit prompts to OpenAi's GPT3 machine learning engine to recieve a variety of unique and human like responses.

You either:
A. Enter in something you want the machine to do or say back to you.
B. Select one of the prompts to get started

Then submit and view your response in the carousel at the bottom of the page, easy peasy
